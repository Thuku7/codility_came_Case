problem 

Write simple .camelCase method for strings. All words must have their first letter capitalized without spaces.

For instance:

'hello case'.camelcase => HelloCase

'camel case word'.camelcase => CamelCaseWord





PseudoCode:

1. create a method camel_case with a parameter string.
2. inside the method create a varible 
3. change the string to an array
4. map through the array an capitalise each element.
5. change the array back to string.
6. remove the white space.
